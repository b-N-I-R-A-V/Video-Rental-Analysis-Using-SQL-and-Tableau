</p>
I found the following facts about the revenue generated by the movies:

- Average Revenue Generated by a movie is $64.
- 50% of the movies generated less than $57.
- Any movie generating more than $164 is an outlier.

- Sports, comedy and new category generated $5 per movie.
- Other categories generated $4 per movie.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

Following are the recommendations based on our findings:
- Reward loyal customers by offering them discounts and special access.
- India, China, and United States have generated highest revenue. These countries along with those in top 10 should be focused more by adjusting renting price according to. Value of the currency like NETFLIX, PRIME and DISNEY are doing.
- Movies that have generated highest revenue such as Telegraph Voyage, Zorro Ark, Wife Turn, Innocent Usual, and Hustler Party should be featured in advertisements on different platforms such as social media and internet.
- To increase revenue increased number of license of movies in the categories Sports, Sci-fi, Comedy, Animation and New should be purchased.

### Challenges
The main challenge in this project was understanding the logic behind one of the questions posed by management, which sought to find the top 5 customers from the top 10 cities within the top 10 countries by customer base. The issue was that within the top 10 countries, there were multiple cities with the same number of customers. This was leaving out customers who were producing more revenue but were not necessarily in the top 10 cities. This challenge was overcome by identifying high-value customers across the globe and creating a separate list of them.
