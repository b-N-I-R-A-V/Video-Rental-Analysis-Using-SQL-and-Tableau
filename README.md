## Results
To communicate the results of the analysis effectively I created a presentation for the board as well as I have put my visualization on Tableau Public which you can check out from this link.[Link to Storyboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nirav.bariya/viz/shared/3ZS4KMBPK)

Here are a few snapshots from the analysis answering key questions defined above.
