</p>
I found the following facts about the revenue generated by the movies:

- Average Revenue Generated by a movie is $64.
- 50% of the movies generated less than $57.
- Any movie generating more than $164 is an outlier.

## Results
To communicate the results of the analysis effectively I created a presentation for the board as well as I have put my visualization on Tableau Public which you can check out from this link.[Link to Storyboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nirav.bariya/viz/shared/3ZS4KMBPK)

Here are a few snapshots from the analysis answering key questions defined above.
